## JavaScript Base64 UTF-8 encoder/decoder

Try it: https://baboures.github.io/tools/b64/

**Features**
- URL-safe mode (replacing ```+``` by ```-```, ```/``` by ```_``` and removing the padding char(s) ```=```)
- ```atob```/```btoa``` enhancement to support full Unicode charset (atob and btoa only support Latin-1 natively)
- UTF-8 encoding
- Works locally
